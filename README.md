## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to automate your finances? Here's how to get started:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/RishavB777/Finance-Automation.git](https://github.com/RishavB777/Finance-Automation.git)
    cd Finance-Automation
    ```

2.  **Installation:**
    * It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
        # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```
    * Install the necessary dependencies. While specific requirements might vary for each script, you can generally install the core libraries using:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
        # Install any other specific libraries mentioned in the script's documentation
        ```

3.  **Explore the Scripts:**
    * Navigate through the repository's directories to find scripts relevant to your needs.
    * Each script will ideally have its own README or comments explaining its functionality, required inputs, and usage instructions.

4.  **Configuration (if needed):**
    * Some scripts might require you to configure API keys, file paths, or other settings. Refer to the script's documentation for specific configuration details.

5.  **Run the Scripts:**
    * Execute the Python scripts using the `python` command:
        ```bash
        python path/to/your/script.py
        ```
